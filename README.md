# User Experience

-   ## User stories

    -   ### First Time Visitor Goals
        1. Quickly understand the main objective of the website and what it offers.
        2. Navigate naturally and easily through the website different pages (using the navbar to go to a specific page or using the arrow on the bottom of the page to navigate entire website in a continuous flow) even if the user is not computer-savy.
        3. Get interested about charity and look for further information within the website.
        4. Understand the powerful outcomes that a simple and small donation can bring to poor kids.


    -   ### Returning Visitor Goals
        1. Be motivated to get in touch with ONE% for more information.
        2. Get motivated and make a new donation to a new institution.
        3. Use the navbar to go to the specific page I am looking for as I already know the website.

    -   ### Frequent User Goals
        1. Navigate the website looking for news updates regarding the different non-profit organizations working in Africa.
        2. Be motivated to keep donating and contacting ONE% looking for partnerships.
        3. Check on new content, new donation pages and news about charity.

-   ## Design
    -   ### Colour Scheme
	    - I have used [Coolors](#https://coolors.co/80d6e6-57bc90-000000-ffffff) to choose the color pallete.
        - The four main colors used are Middle Blue (#80D6E6), Ocean Green (#57BC90), Black (#000000) and White (#FFFFFF). 
        - I choose the colors pallete that are more alive and better represent happiness and childhood for the body. For the navbar and footer I choose a more neutral color for balance and to not take the focus of the main content which is the body of the website.

        ![Color Palette](project/color-palette.JPG)

    -   ### Typography
	    - For the logo, I choose the "Fresca" font to give a very happy looking and better show the purpose of the website.
        - For the quoting phrase on the hero image I choose the "Noto Sans KR" font, a bit lighter then the logo but not so light in order to not be difficult to read and not dissapear on the hero image.
        - For the H2 headers I choose the "Livvic" font to give a good highlight and still maintaining a happy atmosphere.
        - For the content beneth the H2 headings I have used a more default font: "Segoe UI" to focus on readability.

    -   ### Imagery
        - All the images on the site were choosen to bring happiness. I focused more on what the outcomes of charity and donation can bring to the kids instead of showing their poor and sad condition. Hopefully by showing the outcome I can motivate people to donate and understanding the power and the beautiful results that a small donation can bring.
	    - The hero image was carefully choosen to give life to the website and really stand out on the homepage. It was intended to show the happiness and hope that these kids have even living in poor conditions. Happiness is simple, happiness is being grateful for what we have, this is the intent of the images spread across this website and also the intent of the content.
        - The remaining images were choosen due to the vivid contrast they bring and to also show gratitude and happeniness.
        - To avoid images being too heavy to load I have compressed all images using [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) which also compress JPEG images.
