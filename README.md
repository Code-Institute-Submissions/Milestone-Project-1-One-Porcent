    -   #### Colour Scheme
	- The four main colors used are Middle Blue, Ocean Green, Black and White. I choose the colors pallete that are more alive and better represent happiness and childhood for the body. For the navbar and footer I choose a more neutral color for balance.

    -   #### Typography
	- For the logo, I choose a more happy font to better show the purpose of the website (by donating and bringing happiness to kids). The font used for the logo was the "Fresca" font designed by Fontstage.


    -   #### Imagery
	- The hero image was carefully choosen to give life to the website and really stand out on the homepage. It was intended to show the happiness and hope that these kids have even living in poor conditions. Happiness is simple, happiness is being grateful for what we have, this is the intent of the images spread across this website and also the intent of the content.
    - The remaining images were all choosen for the vivid contrast they have and to also show gratitude and happeniness.
