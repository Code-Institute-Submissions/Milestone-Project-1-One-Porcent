ONE% is a charity project. The first main purpose is to make people aware that everyone can donate a really small portion of their income and this would still make a great difference in the lives of many children and adults in poor condition. The second main purpose is to re-direct potential donors to three non-profit organizations where they can donate directly to these organizations.

# User Experience

The website ONE% was created with the main intent to inspire everyone to donate to charity organizations. All the content was chosen to show happiness and gratefulness. It was focused on the happy results that a donation can bring to poor kids. The website content shows that no matter how much you donate, this would still make a huge difference. It also covers the benefits of the donations, why Users should donate, and explain and suggest a donation to three different charity organizations as well as a direct link to the donation page of each organization.

We want to make Users feel grateful for the simple things they have, and to feel the potential impact of their donation.

-   ## Design
    -   ### Colour Scheme
	    - I have used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/80d6e6-57bc90-000000-ffffff) to choose the color pallete.

        - The four main colors used are Middle Blue (#80D6E6), Ocean Green (#57BC90), Black (#000000) and White (#FFFFFF).

        - I choose the colors that are more alive and better represent happiness and childhood for the body. For the navbar and footer I choose a more neutral color for balance and to not take the focus of the main content which is the body of the website.

        ![Color Palette](project/color-palette.JPG)

    -   ### Typography
	    - For the logo, I choose the "Fresca" font to give a very happy looking and better show the purpose of the website.

        - For the quoting phrase on the hero image I choose the "Noto Sans KR" font, a bit lighter than the logo but not so light in order to not be difficult to read and not disappear on the hero image.

        - For the H2 headers I choose the "Livvic" font to give a good highlight and still maintaining a happy atmosphere.

        - For the content beneath the H2 headings I have used a more default font: "Segoe UI" to focus on readability.

        - All fonts were imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

    -   ### Imagery
        - All the images on the site were chosen to show happiness. I focused more on what the outcomes of charity and donation can bring to the kids instead of showing their poor and sad condition. Hopefully, by showing the outcome I can motivate people to donate and understanding the power and the beautiful results that a small donation can bring.

	    - The hero image was carefully chosen to give life to the website and really stand out on the homepage. It was intended to show the happiness and hope that these kids have even when living in poor conditions. Happiness is simple, happiness is being grateful for what we have, this is the intent of the images spread across this website and also the intent of the content.

        - The remaining images were chosen due to the vivid contrast they bring and to also show gratitude and happiness.

        - To avoid images being too heavy to load I have compressed all images using [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) which also compresses JPEG images.

# Testing

- All the links were tested thoroughly (navbar, footer, next page arrows, donation redirects, and contact form).

- Contact form was tested while trying to submit without filling the required fields (Name, Email, and Subject) and I have used the Code Institute formdump.

- The website was tested in Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, both on Windows and Mac OS.

- Through the Console device toolbar it was also tested using the following emulated devices: Moto G4, Galaxy S5, Pixel 2, iPhone 5/SE iPhone 6/7/8, iPhone X, iPad, iPad Pro, Surface Duo.

- Used [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#) for testing different viewports and a [Mockup Generator](http://techsini.com/multi-mockup/index.php) to create the image being used on the top of this readme.

- The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project:

OBS: There is 10 warning due to some -webkits added on CSS, they were imported from external libraries and are needed to add interactivity.

## Testing User Stories

-   ### First Time Visitor Goals
    1. On the index page Users can understand the main objective of the website and what if offers by reading the "Why ONE%?" Section.
    2. I navigated through the entire website pages using the Navbar and the Next Page arrows to confirm all the href links were correct and working.
    3. I have used interactivity on the Index and Why Donate page to keep the website interesting for the user and also added information about the different charity organizations we can redirect the user to under the Donate page. I have tested the interactivity by hovering the mouse on the desktop and touching on it through a mobile.
    4. On the Donation Benefits and on the Why donate page users can understand the difference that a simple donation can bring.
    5. On the Donate page we offer a quick re-direct to the official charity organization directly to the donation page of their website. I have tested the href links re-directing the user to the donation page of each one of the three charity organizations.

-   ### Returning Visitor Goals
    1. Returning Users can use the contact form to send us an email. I have tested the submit by posting data to Code Institute form dump. I have also tested the required option on the contact form fields to make sure users are inserting their name, email, and subject.
    2. Keep returning Users motivated by updating new content on the Home, Why Donate, and Donate page.
    3. Returning Users that already have a focus in mind while accessing the webiste can use the top navigation bar to go straight to the page they want.

-   ### Frequent User Goals
    1. Using the top navbar the Frequent Users can go directly to the Donate page to check on new updates of the non-profity organizations working in Africa.
    2. We want to motivate Frequent Users to keep donating and to check on a new organization he didn't donate to yet by checking the Donate page and the organizations description.
    3. To keep a Frequent User interested in the website we want to have the website always updated with new content and with new organizations on the Donate page.

# Deployment

- For this project, I have used the cloud-based IDE [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/) and [GitHub](http://github.com/) as a free git repository hosting.

    1. I started the project by creating a new Repository on GitHub and loading the [Code Institute Gitpod Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).

    2. Installed the [Gitpod extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-dev-environments-i/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki) and on my GitHub repo I clicked on the Gitpod button to create a new Master Workspace on GitPod.

    3. After creating the workspace I developed the website using Gitpod and pushing my commits to GitHub using the following commands:
        - `git add "file-name"` - To add a file for staging.
        - `git commit -m "description-of-update"` - To commit.
        - `git push` - To push my commits to GitHub
        - I have also used extra git commands such as: 
        - `python3 -m http.server` - To run a preview of the website on the browser.
        - `git status` - To display the current state of the working directory and the staging area.
